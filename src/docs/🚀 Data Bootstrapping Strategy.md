# ðŸš€ Data Bootstrapping Strategy

## Overview

Strategy to bridge the data gap before real user data is available for the PPME system.

---

## 1. Synthetic Training Data Generation

### Core Tasks

- [ ] Persona-based mapping: Use existing `testPersonas.ts` to generate realistic priority-to-policy mappings
- [ ] Confidence simulation: Create realistic confidence scores based on linguistic similarity and semantic matching
- [ ] Variation generation: For each persona, generate 5-10 variations of how they might express the same priorities
- [ ] Create synthetic dataset with at least 500 priority-mapping pairs

---

## 2. Expert Seeding Approach

### Core Tasks

- [ ] Policy expert input: Have 2-3 policy experts manually map 50-100 common priority statements
- [ ] Crowdsourced validation: Use platforms like MTurk to validate and expand expert mappings
- [ ] Academic partnerships: Partner with political science departments for student research projects
- [ ] Create expert validation workflow and tools

---

## 3. Progressive Data Collection

### Core Tasks

- [ ] Feedback incentives: Offer users their personalized results in exchange for validating 3-5 mappings
- [ ] Gamification: "Help improve the system" progress bar that unlocks features
- [ ] Social proof: Show users how many people have contributed feedback
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure of features based on contribution

---

## 4. Intelligent Fallback System

### Core Tasks

- [ ] Design fallback recommendation interface
- [ ] Implement data source tracking

```typescript
interface BootstrapRecommendation {
  confidence: 'synthetic' | 'expert_seeded' | 'user_validated'
  dataSource: string
  fallbackReason: 'insufficient_data' | 'new_priority_pattern'
  improvementSuggestion: string
}
```

---

## 5. Hybrid Confidence Scoring

### Core Tasks

- [ ] Base confidence: Start with keyword matching confidence (60-80%)
- [ ] Expert boost: Add +10-15% for expert-validated mappings
- [ ] User validation: Add +5-10% for each user validation
- [ ] Transparency: Always show data source in UI
- [ ] Implement confidence score calculation algorithm

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

- [ ] Expand synthetic data using existing personas
- [ ] Create confidence simulation algorithms
- [ ] Implement basic fallback system

### Phase 2: Expert Validation (Week 2)

- [ ] Design expert seeding workflow
- [ ] Create validation tools and interfaces
- [ ] Begin expert data collection

### Phase 3: User Engagement (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement progressive feedback collection
- [ ] Add gamification elements
- [ ] Create contribution tracking

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)

- [ ] Deploy hybrid confidence system
- [ ] Add transparency features
- [ ] Monitor and optimize data quality

---

## ðŸ“‹ Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial strategy design
- [x] Documentation creation

### Current Status

**Phase 1** - Foundation (Ready to Begin)

### Next Steps

1. Analyze existing `testPersonas.ts` structure
2. Design synthetic data generation algorithms
3. Create confidence simulation system
