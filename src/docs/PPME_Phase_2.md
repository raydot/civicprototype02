# üõ°Ô∏è Phase 2: Secure PPME Enhancement Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines Phase 2 enhancements for the Political Priorities Mapping Engine (PPME) with integrated security measures to prevent system gaming and manipulation.

---

## 1. Alternative Mapping Suggestions with Integrity Checks

### Core Feature
- [ ] Show 2-3 alternative mappings for low-confidence items
- [ ] Allow users to select preferred mapping
- [ ] Implement mapping selection UI components

### Anti-Gaming Measures

```typescript
// Mapping validation with integrity checks
interface SecureMappingOption {
  termId: string;
  standardTerm: string;
  plainEnglish: string;
  confidence: number;
  validationHash: string; // Prevents tampering
  sourceReasoning: string; // Audit trail
  alternativeRank: number; // Prevents manipulation of order
}
```

### Security Features
- [ ] Cryptographic hashes for each mapping option to prevent client-side tampering
- [ ] Limited alternatives (max 3) to prevent overwhelming users with bad options
- [ ] Audit logging of all user selections for pattern analysis
- [ ] Confidence thresholds - alternatives only shown for genuinely ambiguous cases

---

## 2. Smart Contextual Help with Validation

### Core Feature
- [ ] Tooltips explaining policy terms and confidence scores
- [ ] Progressive disclosure of mapping details
- [ ] Interactive help system

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- [ ] Read-only explanations sourced from verified policy databases
- [ ] Tamper-evident content with checksums
- [ ] Rate limiting on help requests to prevent system probing
- [ ] Consistent messaging - same term always gets same explanation

---

## 3. Advanced Filtering with Audit Trails

### Core Feature
- [ ] Filter by confidence, category, user feedback
- [ ] Sort mappings by various criteria
- [ ] Advanced search capabilities

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- [ ] Immutable filter results - can't be manipulated client-side
- [ ] Audit logging of all filter/sort actions
- [ ] Anomaly detection for unusual filtering patterns
- [ ] Server-side validation of all filter parameters

---

## üîí Core Anti-Gaming Architecture

### Confidence Score Integrity
- [ ] Implement secure confidence scoring system

```typescript
interface SecureConfidenceScore {
  value: number;
  calculationMethod: string;
  inputHash: string; // Hash of original user input
  timestamp: string;
  validationSignature: string; // Server signature
}
```

### Feedback Validation System
- [ ] Create secure feedback collection system

```typescript
interface SecureFeedback {
  userId: string; // Anonymous but trackable
  sessionId: string;
  feedbackType: 'thumbs_up' | 'thumbs_down' | 'alternative_selected';
  originalMapping: string;
  timestamp: string;
  ipHash: string; // For rate limiting
  validationChecks: {
    rateLimitPassed: boolean;
    patternAnalysisPassed: boolean;
    duplicateCheck: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Pattern Detection Algorithms
- [ ] Rapid feedback submission detection
- [ ] Coordinated manipulation across multiple sessions detection
- [ ] Unusual confidence score patterns analysis
- [ ] Geographic clustering of suspicious feedback detection

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### Phase 2A: Foundation Security (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Implement mapping integrity checks
- [ ] Add audit logging system
- [ ] Create confidence score validation
- [ ] Set up basic pattern detection

### Phase 2B: User Features (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Alternative mapping suggestions with security
- [ ] Smart contextual help system
- [ ] Advanced filtering with audit trails
- [ ] Enhanced UI components

### Phase 2C: Monitoring (Week 5)
- [ ] Anomaly detection dashboard
- [ ] Pattern analysis reporting
- [ ] Abuse prevention alerts
- [ ] Security monitoring tools

---

## üìã Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 1: Enhanced visual confidence indicators
- [x] Phase 1: Improved mapping display structure
- [x] Phase 1: Better data structure alignment with issueTerminology.json

### Current Status
**Phase 2A** - Foundation Security (In Planning)

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of mapping integrity checks
2. Design audit logging architecture
3. Create secure confidence score validation system
